## About

ResVault is a Chrome extension that serves as a comprehensive wallet for [ResilientDB](https://resilientdb.com). ResilientDB is a High Throughput Yielding Permissioned Blockchain Fabric founded by [ExpoLab](https://expolab.org/) at [UC Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2018. ResilientDB advocates a system-centric design by adopting a multi-threaded architecture that encompasses deep pipelines. Further, ResilientDB separates the ordering of client transactions from their execution, which allows it to process messages out-of-order.

## Features

- **Delete Account** - Remove accounts with proper cleanup
- **Login/Logout** - Secure authentication system
- **Submit Transactions** - Send transactions to ResilientDB network
- **Transaction Logging** - Complete transaction history and audit trail
- **User Profiles** - Manage multiple user identities
- **Multi-account Support** - Handle multiple wallet accounts simultaneously

### Smart Contract Integration (v1.2.0)
- **Contract Deployment** - Deploy Solidity smart contracts directly from the wallet
- **Address Ownership** - Contracts are deployed using your wallet address for proper ownership
